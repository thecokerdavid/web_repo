            I should be feeling like a celebrity right now that you’ve decided to read about me,
            I must confess I’m humbled. &#128519; <br> <br>
            I know I need to put up a good article about me on this page but I’m sorry if the points seem scattered
            because I’m just going to write the way things pop into my head. <br><br>
            I am Trevor David Coker, a Nigerian guy in his early 20s studying Software Development at the National Institute of Information Technology.
            Truth is, I started studying the science of computers criminal way before college.&#128579; <br><br>
            David is an easy going (my mum might disagree)&#128517;, funny guy that makes friends (and also cuts them) easily.
            Can’t really say about my being funny though, but I feel like the world’s best comedian when talking to friends, maybe they’re giving me false impressions. <br><br>
            Don’t know whether to use “David” now or use “I” but either way, this boy writing this loves tech.&#128525;&#128156;
            I mean LOVES to the letter and likes to be updated even to the minute about the happenings in the tech world. &#128156; <br><br>
            Professionally, David is known as diligent, proactive, and easily adaptable to new environments&#127919; (at least my employers so far agree). <br><br>
            Next vision is learning C# and C, i hope i remember to update this page when I’m done.
